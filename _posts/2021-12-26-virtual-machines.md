## What is a Virtual Machine?

A Virtual Machine (VM) is a computer that runs over software instead of physical computing resources. The system can operate full independent inside the \"host\" machine running programs, and processes in the the same way a normal computer would do. 

A Virtual Machine will run an OS, which could be of any type and version. Some examples would be Windows 10/11/7/XP, a Linux distribution (Arch, Ubuntu, Parrot OS, Linux Mint, etc).
